# How to Contribute

# Scope
DiceTower is specifically designed to be a library for Dice Notation. What that means is, that we are looking for contributions that expand, improve or simplify parsing that notation. TTRPG character creation/storage, Encounter tracking or any other game mechanics are **out of scope** and are best handled as a wrapper around DiceTower.
Similarly, DiceTower is not overly concerned about the graphical display of the results, but the actual results themselves. We may only consider these contributions on a per-case basis.
