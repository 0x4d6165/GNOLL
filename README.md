A comprehensive grammar and libraries for Dice-based RPG systems

In other terms, A language for parsing [Dice Notation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dice_notation), that you can plug into your own dice-based projects

```
   Gridon The Brave: I want to steal from the goblin sitting at the counter
   GM: Okay, give me a stealth check!
   Gridon The Brave: Okay, that's a "1d20+5"
   [Dice]: 25
   GM: You successfully pickpocket the goblin - but all he had were some crummy dice...
```
