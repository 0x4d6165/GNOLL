A comprehensive grammar-based library for rolling dice. DiceTower parses [Dice Notation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dice_notation) for your project, so that you don't have to. Ideal for software or researchers of tabletop gaming.

Here's an example of how you might use DiceTower:
```markdown
   Gridon The Brave: I want to steal from the goblin sitting at the bar.
   Dungeon Master: Okay, give me a stealth check!
   Gridon The Brave: Okay, that's a <1d20+5>
   [DiceTower]: 21
   Dungeon Master: Hurrah! You successfully pickpocket the goblin! However, all he had in there were some crummy dice...
```

[You can follow Grindon's adventure through the world of dice notation in our Wiki](https://github.com/ianfhunter/dice-tower/wiki/Dice-Roll-Syntaxes)

## Current Status

### Dice Notation
DiceTower supports a lot of different notations. Too many to explain here so [we've got a seperate section in our wiki](https://github.com/ianfhunter/dice-tower/wiki/Dice-Roll-Syntaxes).

### Language Support

We wrote DiceTower to be the definitive solution to dice notation. We've written all the code in C, but fear not! We will be adding wrappers for you to access DiceTower's functionality in the near future.

#### Currently
- C
- Python

**Note:** There is no Windows/POSIX support yet.

#### Backlog

 - Javascript
 - PHP
 - Ruby

## Getting Started

Setup for the various languages can be found on [the Wiki](https://github.com/ianfhunter/dice-tower/wiki)

### Prerequisites

Some languages may have other prerequsites, but these will be common throughout:

- Linux Support (We have an open issue with support on POSIX systems e.g. Cygwin, WSL)

Apt:
```
sudo apt-get install bison flex make python3-pip -y
```

### Build and Test

Simply run the following to build the application:
```bash
   make all
```

You can run our tests too:
```bash
   make test
```


(Note: The following is currently not live. As of now, you can pipe a file containing the roll into the script)
You should be able to try out rolling some dice now!
```
$ dice 1d20
20
```

### Use it in your application
Again, please see the wiki for the various languages instructions [the Wiki](https://github.com/ianfhunter/dice-tower/wiki)

#### Python

```bash
pip install dicetower
```

Then
```python
exit_code, result = roll("1d4")
```
