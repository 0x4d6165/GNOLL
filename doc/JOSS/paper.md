# Summary

DiceTower is a highly compatible dice-rolling library supporting a large range of dice notation syntax common in tabletop roleplaying (TTRPG) games.

# Statement of Need
Whilst there are several dice rolling utilities on the market for research/commercial use there is no current solution which is:
- Open source 
- Using a low level language like C for maximal integration
- supporting multiple notation standards
- supporting non-simplex combinations of notation. 

While some solutions may offer one or two of these, DiceTower addresses all of these points.
