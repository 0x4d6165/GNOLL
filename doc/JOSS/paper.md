# Summary

DiceTower is a highly compatible dice-rolling library supporting a large range of dice notation syntax common in tabletop roleplaying games.

# Statement of Need
Whilst there are several dice rolling utilities on the market for research/commercial use there is no current solution which is A) Open source B) Using a low level language like C for maximal integration C) supporting multiple standards of notation and D) supporting non-simplex combinations of notation. While some solutions may offer one or two of these, DiceTower addresses all of these points.
