# Grindon's Adventure
```
   Grindon: Oh gosh, uh. What's in the room?! How close is the gnoll?
   GM: He's just coming through the door. There's a small table, a chest and some barrels of oil.
   Grindon: Oil! I light a torch and throw a match, diving back into the fireplace.
   GM: This is gonna be a close one! Roll an athletics check to get into the fireplace and an exploding d6 for the barrel of oil.
   Grindon: Okay that's... 1d20+4 then... d6!
   GNOLL: [18]
   GNOLL: [25]
   GM: The explosion blasts behind you as you dive inside. You still take 4 damage as you smash into the stone and your ears ring as the barrel bursts, evaporating the gnoll.
   Grindon The Brave: Ouch! 
   GM: I'm pretty sure whatever else is in this cave heard that too :)
```

# Traditional Explosions

When a dice is marked as Exploding ("!"), if it rolls its maximum value, we will reroll it one again and add the result. If it keeps hitting the max value, we keep rolling.

> Note: If you want to only re-roll once, look at "Rerolling" below instead.

## Multiple Explosions
Note: if you explode multiple dice, they will be grouped together as a condition for explosion:

```2d3! -> Explodes on (3)(3)```

If you want to explode them individually try:

```d3! + d3! -> Explodes on (3) and Explodes on (3)```

# Penetrating Explosions
When an explosion is set off, the range of the next dice is reduced by 1 step. As we don't want to encode any system specific mechanics here, the 'steps' of dice need to be specified.

Not Implemented Yet. See [Issue #11](https://github.com/ianfhunter/GNOLL/issues/11) 


# Diminishing Explosions
*Under Construction*

<!---
When an explosion is set off, we roll a smaller dice each time.
e.g. 1d20,1d12,d10,d8,d6,d4

As this system is not locked into particular rpg sets, you must define these in a variable. This also gives the option of incrementing explosions and non-directional explosions.
> d20![d12,d10,d8,d6,d4]

We recommend creating a macro for common use cases:
$DND_5E_EXPLOSION_SET=d12,d10,d8,d6,d4 ; d20![$DND_5E_EXPLOSION_SET]

> What the dice here was roll several max values (3,3,3,3) and finally a 1. A max value triggers another roll to be added on.

# Imploding dice

*UNDER CONSTRUCTION*

<--
There is no consistent standard for imploding dice. Here are a few candidates:
 - [Inverse Explosion - Rerolling when not matching your number](https://www.welshpiper.com/imploding-dice/)
 - [Negative Explosion](http://www.firehawkgames.biz/?qa_faqs=what-is-an-imploding-dice-roll)
-->

## Inverse Explosion
This seems an unlikely use case as it involves many rolls, and at a tabletop, that's not quite feasible. Until this is clarified, it is deemed out of the current scope of the project

(TODO: Add Explanation)

## Negative Explosion
*UNDER CONSTRUCTION*
This can be triggered with "~" instead of "!". It activates on the lowest number match rather than the highest. The rerolled values are subtracted from the total.
